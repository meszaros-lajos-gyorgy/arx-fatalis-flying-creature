A project dedicated for reviving the unimplemented [flying creature](https://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Flying_Creature) of [Arx Fatalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arx_Fatalis).

## Requirements

These scripts work in all versions of Arx Fatalis, no mods required.

[Arx Libertatis](https://arx-libertatis.org/) 1.2+ is recommended because of it's script console, which makes
spawning the creature a lot easier. Grab a snapshot version from [this page](https://arx-libertatis.org/files/snapshots/).

## Installing

1. download this repository as a zip file
2. extract it's contents to a temporary folder
3. copy the contents of the `src` folder of the extracted contents (make sure to keep directory structure)
4. go to the folder, where Arx Fatalis is installed
5. paste copied contents of the `src` folder to the game's root folder

## Spawning the flying creature in game

### Using the Arx Libertatis 1.2+ script console

1. start a new game
2. open the console 
3. execute the following script: `spawn npc flying_creature/flying_creature.teo marker_0382`

### Using vanilla Arx Fatalis

1. start a new game
2. combine any item with the skull in your cell
